# Telecom Growth Analysis For TellCo Company

## Project Description

This repository contains telecom analysis for TellCo, a mobile service provider in Pefkakia. Analyzes dataset, uncovers growth opportunities, and provides a recommendation on acquisition/divestiture. Includes comprehensive report and interactive web-based dashboard.

## Situational Overview (Business Need)

You are working for a wealthy investor that specialises in purchasing assets that are undervalued. This investor’s due diligence on all purchases includes a detailed analysis of the data that underlies the business, to try to understand the fundamentals of the business and especially to identify opportunities to drive profitability by changing the focus of which products or services are being offered.

Your last role with this investor saw you do a rich analysis of a delivery company and you helped to identify that delivery to university students was the most profitable route to follow, and your analysis helped the investor purchase this delivery company and ramp up profits by 25% within 6 months through focussing on the most profitable aspect of the business. This was driven by university students always being hungry, awake at all hours, willing to purchase from a limited food menu, and tending to live within a small geographical area.

The investor is interested in purchasing TellCo, an existing mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia. TellCo’s current owners have been willing to share their financial information but have never employed anyone to look at the data that is generated automatically by their systems.
